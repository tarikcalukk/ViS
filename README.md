# **Projects: Probability and Prob and Stat**

## **Probability**

As part of a team project, I contributed to the development of a comprehensive Python-based application for analyzing student performance data. This project aimed to explore and understand the factors influencing student success across various subjects, including math, reading, and writing, by leveraging a rich dataset that encompassed demographic factors such as gender, ethnicity, and parental education levels.

We began by preprocessing the data using **Pandas**, which allowed us to efficiently handle and manipulate large datasets. This included cleaning the data, managing missing values, and transforming categorical variables into numerical formats for further analysis.

To visually present our findings, we utilized libraries such as **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** to create insightful visualizations. Through these visualizations, we generated histograms, scatter plots, and box plots, which enabled us to observe trends and distributions within the data. For example, we examined the performance of students based on gender and ethnicity, uncovering valuable insights into how these demographic factors impact academic outcomes.

In addition to exploratory data analysis, we implemented advanced statistical techniques to derive deeper insights. This included calculating probabilities associated with student performance and constructing confidence intervals to understand the reliability of our estimates. We also conducted hypothesis testing, such as Chi-Square tests, to evaluate the relationships between categorical variables, providing a statistical foundation for our findings.

Moreover, we calculated key performance metrics, including mean, median, mode, and variance, for each subject area. This statistical analysis allowed us to summarize student performance effectively and identify areas for improvement.

Throughout the project, each output was carefully documented, and our insights were supported with relevant statistical evidence. This structured approach emphasized the importance of data-driven decision-making in education. The collaborative nature of the project fostered effective teamwork, enabling us to combine our skills in data analysis, visualization, and statistical testing to deliver a comprehensive understanding of student performance trends.

By the end of the project, we presented a well-rounded analysis that not only highlighted key performance indicators but also offered actionable insights for educators and stakeholders to enhance student outcomes.

## **Prob and Stat**

In this project, we analyze employee attrition rates using a dataset that contains various demographic and performance metrics. The analysis aims to identify patterns and relationships in the data that may contribute to employee turnover.

The project utilizes several key libraries, including **Pandas** for data manipulation, **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for data visualization, and **SciPy** for statistical testing. A variety of visualizations are created to present the data effectively, including histograms, box plots, and bar charts to explore relationships between employee attributes such as age, gender, education, and training.

Key analyses conducted in the project include a **Chi-Square Test** to evaluate the independence between categorical variables, providing insights into the relationships between different departments and employee demographics. We also applied the **Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test** to assess the normality of the distribution of the 'Age' variable, which helps to determine the appropriate statistical methods for further analysis.

Additionally, confidence intervals are calculated for various employee metrics to estimate the range within which the true population parameter is likely to fall. We conducted further statistical evaluations to understand commuting patterns and the factors influencing employee satisfaction. This included calculating the probability that employees with certain characteristics completed training courses and analyzing the average distance employees commute to work.

The findings from this analysis will assist in understanding the factors contributing to employee attrition and can inform strategies for retention. Overall, this project demonstrates the effective use of data analysis and visualization techniques in addressing real-world business challenges related to employee turnover.
